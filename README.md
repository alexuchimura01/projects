### Analzing Technology Sales Representatives: The Impact of Traits on Employee Metrics
Project Description: Worked as a team of four MSBA students to conduct business analysis on a big dataset. Cleaned data on 21,990 hardware and software sales representatives from a large technology company including employee performance metrics, demographics, peer feedback, customer satisfaction indicators, other identifying factors to help answer: 1) What is the ideal tech sales representative? 2) Which variables best predict feedback and net promoter score (NPS)? 3) How can the data assist in salary negotiations? Used both supervised (linear regression and regression trees) and unsupervised (K-means analysis and principal component analysis) learning methods to provide recommendations on employee placement, salary negotiaion, and certification sponsoring to increase higher peer and customer feedback. Findings included that the ideal tech sales rep has explorer or diplomat personality types on average (higher correlation with higher NPS/feedback), firms should prioritize certification sponsorship and employee retention, and that our regression tree is a great option to negotiate salaries from the firm's perspective due to an MPE of -5.1% (underestimates salaries by about 5%).
